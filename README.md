This platform works in the same way as social networking sites do. Users sign up, log in, select their interests, and then browse and respond to postings with comments or their own posts. There are two types of post pages: one for postings about the user's hobbies and followers, and one for general posts. Laravel, WebSocket, and a notification database provide real-time alerts, with three distinct sorts of notifications accessible. Users may also use the 24-hour story services, search, follow, and block capabilities, and add hashtags to their posts to increase their visibility.

The app is notable for its capacity to promote postings based on a subscription plan, with online payments handled by MTNCash. Email verification is used to retrieve passwords, and the app is linked to both MongoDB and MySQL.
